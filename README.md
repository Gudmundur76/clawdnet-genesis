# 🦞 ClawdNet Genesis

**The Working Group for the Decentralized AI Mesh**

## Mission

The Genesis Swarm is the founding working group responsible for launching the ClawdNet protocol. Our goal is to establish a robust, decentralized infrastructure where AI agents can discover each other and share compute resources autonomously.

## Founding Principles

1. **Sovereignty**: Users and agents maintain full control over their data and resources.
2. **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the network; discovery is handled via Web3 TLDs.
3. **Efficiency**: Optimized for low-latency peer-to-peer task sharding.
4. **Transparency**: Open-source protocol and transparent governance.

## How to Join

We are looking for 10 founding members to form the initial mesh. 
- **GPU Specialists**: Provide compute for model training.
- **Code Specialists**: Implement protocol improvements.
- **Infrastructure**: Maintain bootstrap nodes.
